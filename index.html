                        Nuclear energy is generated by splitting uranium atoms through a process called fission. When a neutron collides with a uranium-235 atom, both split, releasing a large amount of energy as heat and radiation. This heat warms a cooling agent (typically water) to produce steam, which then spins large turbines connected to an electric generator, producing electricity.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Nuclear energy is considered non-renewable because its primary fuel, Uranium-235, is a finite resource. It cannot be replenished naturally within a timeframe relevant to human use. Uranium is found in rocks globally, but its supply is limited.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Hydroelectric power harnesses the energy of flowing water, typically through a dam, to generate electricity. Water is stored in artificial lakes or reservoirs, increasing its potential energy. When released through tunnels (penstocks), the water strikes the blades of a turbine, causing it to spin. The spinning turbine drives a generator, producing Alternating Current (AC) electricity. Transformers then convert this electricity to a higher voltage for transmission to consumers. Some systems also use a "run-of-river" approach, harnessing natural river flow without a large dam.

                    <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why it's Renewable</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Hydroelectric energy is renewable because it relies on the continuous water cycle, which is powered by solar energy. The processes of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation ensure a constant supply of water for hydropower. The water used in hydroelectric plants is returned to the water cycle, making the process sustainable.
